- Save user names when a message is received from the user
- Advise the agent that validation error responses do not come from the user themselves, so there's no need to acknowledge or apologize for them, just to provide a new input that will not cause the error again
- Individual scheduling (if > X responses in Y minutes, schedule forward by Z minutes)
- Fix FULL resetting logic (including message sent) — needs some re-flowing
- Bug with thought bubble not disappearing on an error
- Enable cascade deletion (e.g. conversation -> generations, but also the rest)
